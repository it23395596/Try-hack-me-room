XSSposed - TryHackMe Room Write-Up

Introduction:
Warm greetings from XSSposed, a TryHackMe room that teaches participants Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with hands-on, real-world simulation exercises. You will learn the three principal types of XSS: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-Based. Each of these will be represented in tasks modeled after real-world scenarios.

The room is a combination of hosted labs and downloadable HTML applications which resemble and function like real websites. Learners are given a taste of the experience that security experts have during bug bounty and penetration testing skirmishes.

Challenge Setup
Lab Types:
Hosted Reflected and Stored XSS Labs: Labs hosted online to simulate vulnerable web features Downloadable HTML lab for DOM-Based XSS: Simulates client-side vulnerabilities within realistic frontend code.
Objectives

1.Understand the differences between each type of XSS and how they function.
2.Learn to identify and exploit XSS in multiple scenarios. 
3.Locate concealed flags within exploitable applications. 
4.Comprehend ways to mitigate each type of vulnerability mentioned above.

Room Task Breakdown
